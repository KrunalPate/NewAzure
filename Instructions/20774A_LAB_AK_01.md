5.  In the top right of the page, confirm that the workspace is called **&lt;*your name*&gt;-Free-Workspace**.
6.  Leave Internet Explorer running.

>**Results**: At the end of this exercise, you will have a working Machine Learning Studio account and workspace.

## Exercise 2: Explore a sample machine learning experiment

#### Task 1: Open the Quantile Regression: car price regression sample experiment

1.  On the **20774A-LON-DEV** virtual machine, ensure that you are logged in as **ADATUM\AdatumAdmin**.
2.  In Internet Explorer, in the **Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio** workspace, in the left-hand pane, click **EXPERIMENTS**.
3.  On the **experiments** page, click **SAMPLES**.
4.  In the list of samples, click **Quantile Regression: Car price prediction** (note: if there are two similar experiments displayed, select the experiment with the most recent date).
5.  Note that this experiment starts with a dataset **Automobile price data (Raw)**, and then includes a range of modules.

#### Task 2: View the Quantile Regression: car price regression sample experiment

1.  When an experiment has finished running, all modules will show a green check mark to indicate that they have successfully finished.
2.  In the **Properties** pane, note the start and end times, and the status code; this shows when the experiment was last run, and whether the run was successful.
3.  To view the output from the **Score Model** module, double-click the (lower) output port of the **Score Model** module.
4.  Scroll right to locate the **price** and the three **scores** columns.
5.  The output shows the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles for the price.
6.  Click the **price** column, and note that **Statistics** and **Visualizations** are now displayed for this data.
7.  Click the **x** at the top-right of the page, to close the visualization.

#### Task 3: Evaluate the Quantile Regression: car price regression sample experiment

1.  In the **Microsoft** **Azure Machine Learning Studio** workspace, ensure that the **Car price prediction** experiment is open.
2.  To view the output from the **Evaluate Model** module, double-click the (lower) output port of the **Evaluate Model** module.
3.  Click each column in turn, and note the statistics for each set of data.
4.  Click the **x** at the top-right of the page to close the Evaluation results.
5.  In the **Microsoft** **Azure Machine Learning Studio** workspace, click the user image at the top-right, and click **Sign Out**.
