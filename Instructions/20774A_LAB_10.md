## Exercise 1: Publish a Machine Learning model

### Scenario
In this exercise, you will modify and publish a sample Machine Learning experiment, that uses Two-Class Boosted Decision Tree to predict the income of an adult based on features regarding his or her profession and demographics.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:
1. Create a standard Machine Learning Workspace
2. Open a sample experiment
3. Publish the experiment as a web service
4. Add export path as a web service parameter
5. Deploy the web service

#### Task 1: Create a standard Machine Learning Workspace
1.  Create a Machine Learning Workspace using the following information:
    - Workspace name: **&lt;your name&gt;-workspace**
    - Subscription: **Azure Pass**
    - Resource group: (create new) **workspacerg**
    - Location: choose the nearest location
    - Storage account: (create new) accept default **&lt;unique&gt;**
    - Web service plan: (create new) accept default
    - Web service plan pricing tier: **DevTest Standard**

#### Task 2: Open a sample experiment
1.  In Machine Learning Studio, create a new experiment from **Sample 5: Train, Test, Evaluate for Binary Classification: Adult Dataset**.
2.  This sample takes census data details and attempts to predict adult income. It trains one machine learning model, the **Two-Class Boosted Decision Tree**, and evaluates the results.
3.  Familiarize yourself with the experiment by looking at the **Select Columns in Dataset** and **Train Model** modules.
4.  Run the experiment.

#### Task 3: Publish the experiment as a web service
1.  Create a predictive experiment, using the click **Predictive Web Service (Recommended)** option.
2.  Add an **Export Data** module, and connect the **Score Model** output to the **Export Data** module.

#### Task 4: Add export path as a web service parameter
1.  Configure the Export Data module, with the following information:
    -   Azure account name: **&lt;*your storage account*&gt;**
    -   Azure account key: **key1** from your Azure storage access keys
    -   Path to Blob beginning with container: **container1/output1.csv** (and set this path as a web service parameter)
2.  Change the web service parameter name to **blobpath**.
3.  Change the Azure Blob storage write mode to **Overwrite**.
4.  Add a **Select Columns in Dataset** module, and select the **Scored Labels** and **Scored Probabilities** columns.
5.  Connect the output of **Select Columns in Dataset** to the input for **web service output**.
6.  Run the experiment.

#### Task 5: Deploy the web service
1.  Deploy the experiment as a web service, using the select **New Web Services Experience preview** option, and using the price plan you specified in Task 1.
2.  Wait until the **Machine Learning Web Services** page has opened, before continuing to the next exercise.

**Results**: At the end of this exercise, you will have published a Machine Learning model.

## Exercise 2: Consume a Machine Learning model

### Scenario
In this exercise, you will consume your published Machine Learning experiment, using several methods. First you will use the Fiddler Composer tool to test the Request Response Service, by sending HTTP requests that you define. Then you will use Visual StudioÂ®, and C\# code, to test the Batch Execution Service. Finally, you will use the Microsoft Excel Machine Learning add-in, with the Request Response Service.
