    ) AS PKIDDate
    ,[TransactionDate]
FROM [Sales].[Customers] AS customers
LEFT OUTER JOIN
    [Sales].[CustomerTransactions] AS customertransactions
    ON customers.CustomerID = customertransactions.CustomerID;
```

12. Close the visualization by clicking the **x** at the top-right of the window.
13. Click the output port of the **Summarize Data** module below **Import Data**, and then click **Visualize**.
14. Note that there are six rows (features) in this dataset.
15. Close the visualization by clicking the **x** at the top-right of the window.
16. In the **Search experiment items** box, type **Join**, and then from the module list, drag **Join Data** on to the experiment canvas, between and below **DateHolidayPromo** and **Import Data**.
