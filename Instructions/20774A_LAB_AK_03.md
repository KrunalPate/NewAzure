### Exercise 3: Converting imported data into separate datasets

#### Task 1: Visualize imported data

01. In your **Import Data into Azure ML** experiment, double-click the (lower) output port of the left-hand **Import Data** module (the one you used to import data from Azure Blob storage), and then click **Visualize**.
02. Note that there are 16 columns of data; click a column to view a histogram of the data.
03. Close the visualization by clicking the **x** at the top-right of the window.
04. Double-click the (lower) output port of the right-hand **Import Data** module (the one you used to import data from Azure SQL Database), and then click **Visualize**.
05. Note that this data comprises 5 columns and 97,547 rows.
06. Click the **TaxAmount** column to see a distribution for this data as a histogram.
07. Close the visualization by clicking the **x** at the top-right of the window.
08. In the **Search experiment items** box, type **Summarize**, and then from the module list, drag **Summarize Data** on to the right-hand side of the experiment canvas.
09. Connect **Summarize Data** to **Import Data**. To do this, click the right-hand **Import Data** module, and the output node will show the number 1. Click the output node and, keeping the mouse pressed down, draw a line from the **Import Data** module to the input (top) port of the **Summarize Data** module.
10. Run the experiment by clicking **RUN** at the bottom of the page.
11. When the experiment has finished running, all modules will show a green check mark to indicate that they have successfully finished.
12. When the experiment has run successfully, right-click the output (lower) port of the **Summarize Data** module, and then click **Visualize** to see if the data was imported successfully.
13. Note that the **Summarize Data** module has transposed the columns from the raw data into rows, and has generated summary statistics from the 97,547 rows in the original data; verify that there are now 5 rows and 23 columns.
14. Close the visualization by clicking the **x** at the top-right of the window.
15. Click **SAVE** at the bottom of the page.

#### Task 2: Split imported data into separate datasets

01. In Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio, in your **Import Data into Azure ML** experiment, in the **Search experiment items** box, type **Split**, and then from the module list, drag **Split Data** on to the experiment canvas.
02. Connect **Split Data** to **Import Data**. To do this, click the right-hand **Import Data** module, and the output node will show the number 1. Click the output node and, keeping the mouse pressed down, draw a line from the **Import Data** module to the input (top) port of the **Split Data** module.
03. Click **Split Data**.
04. In the **Properties** pane, in the **Fraction of rows in the first output** **dataset** box, type **0.7**.
05. In the **Search experiment items** box, type **Convert**, and then from the module list, drag **Convert to Dataset** on to the experiment canvas.
06. Connect the input (top) port of the **Convert to Dataset** module to the left-hand output node of the **Split Data** module.
07. Right-click the **Convert to Dataset** module, and click **Copy**.
08. Right-click the experiment canvas, and click **Paste**.
09. Connect the input (top) port of the pasted **Convert to Dataset** module to the right-hand output node of the **Split Data** module.
10. You should now have two **Convert to Dataset** tasks, one with 70 percent of the data, and the other with 30 percent of the data.
11. Run the experiment, by clicking **RUN** at the bottom of the page.
12. When the experiment has finished running, all modules will show a green check mark to indicate that they have successfully finished.

#### Task 3: Confirm creation of split datasets

01. When the experiment in the previous task has run successfully, right-click the output (lower) port of the left-hand **Convert to Dataset** module, and then click **Visualize**.
02. Note that this **Convert to Dataset** module has 68,283 rows of data.
03. Close the visualization by clicking the **x** at the top-right of the window.
04. Right-click the output (lower) port of the right-hand **Convert to Dataset** module, and then click **Visualize**.
05. Note that this **Convert to Dataset** module has 29,264 rows of data.
06. Close the visualization by clicking the **x** at the top-right of the window.
07. Verify that 68,283 and 29,264 are 70 percent and 30 percent respectively of the original 97,547 rows from the imported Azure SQL Database.
08. Click **SAVE** at the bottom of the page.
09. Close Internet Explorer.

>**Results**: After this exercise, you will have visualized some imported data, split this data into two datasets, and then confirmed that the split has been successful.
